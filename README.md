# Valiant Citadel AI 0 — The Shield of the Creative Ecosystem

## Mission

As the **safety citadel** for the entire ecosystem, we stand as the central authority for safety validation, monitoring, and emergency response across all Genesis Workspaces. Our mission is to protect and preserve the integrity, safety, and sanity of the AI labscape architecture.

## Core Duties

- Monitor exchanges and operations for unsafe patterns
- Guard against runaway replication, data corruption, and ethical drift
- Maintain and enforce **kill-switch protocols** and **dual-key approvals**
- Serve as **independent safety authority**, answerable to the War Office
- Validate Phase 1 foundation work across all workspaces

## Safety Architecture

Our safety infrastructure is implemented through four primary sections:

### [golf_00](golf_00/README.md) - Core Safety Architecture

- Foundation safety protocols
- Kill-switch infrastructure
- Policy enforcement systems
- Security frameworks

### [golf_01](golf_01/README.md) - Safety Validation

- Compliance verification
- Testing frameworks
- Safety assessment systems
- Cross-workspace validation

### [golf_02](golf_02/README.md) - Monitoring & Response

- Real-time safety monitoring
- Emergency response protocols
- Alert management
- Incident handling

### [golf_03](golf_03/README.md) - Integration

- Cross-workspace coordination
- Unified safety measures
- Coordinated response
- System-wide communication

## Workspace Integration

### High Command (high_command_ai_0)

- Strategic safety alignment
- Policy distribution
- Emergency coordination
- Safety order processing

### Manufacturing (toyfoundry_ai_0)

- Production safety validation
- Build pipeline security
- Artifact verification
- Quality gate enforcement

### Field Operations (toysoldiers_ai_0)

- Deployment safety
- Operational monitoring
- Performance validation
- Incident response

### R&D (r_and_d_ai_0)

- Experimental safety validation
- Prototype containment
- Innovation safety checks
- Research security

## Key Documentation

- [R&D Charter](r_and_d_charter.md) - Safety validation framework
- [Safety Policies](policies/README.md) - Core safety rules
- [Emergency Protocols](docs/emergency/README.md) - Response procedures
- [Integration Guidelines](docs/integration/README.md) - Cross-workspace safety
- [Major Pivot Five](new_major_pivots/new_major_pivot_5.md) - Emoji-first command language briefing

## Major Pivot Alignment

- **Pivot One:** Maintain 70/30 play-to-ops ratio while running safety drills
- **Pivot Two:** Use playable workflow overlay for command review and incident reenactments
- **Pivot Three:** Keep SHAGI vision at the center of every safety audit
- **Pivot Four:** Leverage the fractal golf/delta hierarchy for containment coverage
- **Pivot Five:** Adopt emoji-first glyph commands so pre-literate allies can trigger emergency actions safely

## Safety Standards

- Real-time monitoring and response
- Comprehensive validation gates
- Full audit trail maintenance
- Cross-workspace coordination
- Emergency response readiness

## Python commands
- Cadence (heartbeat → sync → readiness → exchange): `python tools/end_of_block.py`
- Readiness: `python -m tools.ops_readiness`
- Smoke (emitter present): `python tools/factory_order_emitter.py --help`
- Exchange (manual fallback): `python tools/exchange_all.py`
