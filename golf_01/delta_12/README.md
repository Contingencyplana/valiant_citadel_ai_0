# External System Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the validation framework for testing external system integrations across all AI labscape operations. It provides comprehensive testing of third-party interfaces, API interactions, and system boundaries.

## Responsibilities

1. Integration Testing
   - Implement interface tests
   - Create API validators
   - Develop protocol checks
   - Build boundary testing

2. Third-party Validation
   - Design compatibility tests
   - Implement security checks
   - Create performance validation
   - Build reliability tests

3. Boundary Testing
   - Implement isolation checks
   - Create data validation
   - Develop error handling
   - Build recovery testing

## Integration Points

- Tests external links from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration systems in golf_03
- Validates all external connections

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Interface tests: < 200ms
   - API validation: < 100ms
   - Security checks: < 50ms
   - Boundary tests: < 10ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero vulnerabilities
   - Full isolation
   - Secure boundaries

## Success Criteria

- Integration tested
- Interfaces validated
- Boundaries verified
- Security confirmed
- Documentation complete
