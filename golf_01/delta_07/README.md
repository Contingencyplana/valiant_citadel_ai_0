# Security Validation Framework

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive security validation framework for all AI labscape safety systems. It provides testing and verification of access controls, authentication mechanisms, and security boundaries.

## Responsibilities

1. Access Testing
   - Implement access validators
   - Create permission tests
   - Develop role verification
   - Build boundary checks

2. Authentication Validation
   - Design auth test suites
   - Implement identity checks
   - Create credential tests
   - Build session validators

3. Security Testing
   - Implement security scans
   - Create penetration tests
   - Develop threat analysis
   - Build vulnerability checks

## Integration Points

- Tests security from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration security in golf_03
- Validates all safety systems

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Access tests: < 100ms
   - Auth validation: < 200ms
   - Security scans: < 1s
   - Threat analysis: < 500ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero vulnerabilities
   - Full audit trail
   - Breach prevention

## Success Criteria

- Access testing active
- Authentication verified
- Security validated
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
