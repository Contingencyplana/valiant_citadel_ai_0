# Resource Validation Systems

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive resource validation framework that ensures safe and compliant resource usage across all AI labscape operations. It provides testing and verification of resource allocation, usage patterns, and boundaries.

## Responsibilities

1. Resource Testing
   - Implement allocation tests
   - Create usage validators
   - Develop capacity checks
   - Build boundary testers

2. Usage Pattern Validation
   - Design pattern analyzers
   - Implement trend testing
   - Create anomaly detection
   - Build verification tools

3. Boundary Testing
   - Implement limit checks
   - Create overflow tests
   - Develop isolation validation
   - Build safety verifiers

## Integration Points

- Tests resources from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration testing in golf_03
- Validates all resource usage

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Allocation tests: < 50ms
   - Usage validation: < 100ms
   - Boundary checks: < 10ms
   - Pattern analysis: < 200ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero resource leaks
   - Full isolation
   - Audit compliance

## Success Criteria

- Resource tests active
- Usage validated
- Boundaries verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
