# Safety Gate Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive validation framework for safety gates across all AI labscape operations. It provides testing and verification of gate logic, transitions, and approval workflows.

## Responsibilities

1. Gate Logic Verification
   - Implement logic testers
   - Create rule validators
   - Develop state checkers
   - Build transition tests

2. Transition Testing
   - Design transition tests
   - Implement state validation
   - Create flow verification
   - Build sequence checks

3. Workflow Validation
   - Implement approval tests
   - Create process validators
   - Develop role checks
   - Build audit tools

## Integration Points

- Tests gates from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration gates in golf_03
- Validates all safety transitions

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Logic tests: < 50ms
   - Transition checks: < 100ms
   - Workflow validation: < 200ms
   - State verification: < 10ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Zero invalid transitions
   - Complete coverage
   - Full audit trail
   - Process integrity

## Success Criteria

- Gate tests operational
- Transitions validated
- Workflows verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
