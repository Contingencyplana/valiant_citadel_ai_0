# Cross-Workspace Safety Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the cross-workspace validation framework that ensures safety coordination and compliance across all AI labscape workspaces. It provides comprehensive testing and verification of inter-workspace safety mechanisms.

## Responsibilities

1. Cross-Workspace Tests
   - Implement test coordinators
   - Create sync validators
   - Develop integration tests
   - Build verification tools

2. Protocol Verification
   - Design verification flows
   - Implement protocol tests
   - Create validation tools
   - Build compliance checks

3. Integration Testing
   - Implement test scenarios
   - Create coordination checks
   - Develop sync validators
   - Build result analyzers

## Integration Points

- Validates core safety from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration systems in golf_03
- Tests all workspace connections

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Cross-tests: < 200ms
   - Protocol verify: < 100ms
   - Integration tests: < 500ms
   - Results analysis: < 1s

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero sync issues
   - Full verification
   - Audit compliance

## Success Criteria

- Cross-testing active
- Protocols verified
- Integration tested
- Coordination validated
- Documentation complete
