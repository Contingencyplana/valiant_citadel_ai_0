# Control System Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive validation framework for control systems across all AI labscape operations. It provides testing and verification of control mechanisms, override systems, and emergency interventions.

## Responsibilities

1. Control Testing
   - Implement control validators
   - Create response tests
   - Develop timing checks
   - Build verification tools

2. Override Validation
   - Design override tests
   - Implement auth checks
   - Create safety interlocks
   - Build audit systems

3. Emergency Testing
   - Implement crisis scenarios
   - Create response validation
   - Develop recovery tests
   - Build performance checks

## Integration Points

- Tests controls from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration controls in golf_03
- Validates all safety controls

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Control tests: < 10ms
   - Override checks: < 5ms
   - Emergency validation: < 1ms
   - Response timing: < 50ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero failures
   - Full audit trail
   - Response verification

## Success Criteria

- Control tests active
- Overrides validated
- Emergency tested
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
