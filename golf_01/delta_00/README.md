# Validation Protocol Core

## Purpose

This delta implements the foundational validation protocol framework for ensuring safety across all AI labscape operations. It provides the base architecture for testing, verification, and validation of all safety systems.

## Responsibilities

1. Base Validation Framework
   - Implement validation core
   - Create protocol checkers
   - Develop test runners
   - Build verification engines

2. Test Suite Architecture
   - Design test frameworks
   - Implement suite management
   - Create execution engines
   - Build result processors

3. Verification Pipelines
   - Implement pipeline flows
   - Create stage validators
   - Develop result handlers
   - Build reporting systems

## Integration Points

- Validates core safety in golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration validation in golf_03
- Verifies all safety systems

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Protocol checks: < 10ms
   - Test execution: < 100ms
   - Result processing: < 50ms
   - Report generation: < 1s

2. Quality Standards
   - 100% test coverage
   - Zero false positives
   - Complete traceability
   - Full reproducibility

## Success Criteria

- Framework operational
- Test suites running
- Pipelines validated
- Integration verified
- Documentation complete
