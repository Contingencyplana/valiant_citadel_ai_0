# Kill-Switch Verification Framework

## Purpose

This delta implements the core verification framework for ensuring reliable and effective kill-switch operations across AI systems. It provides validation protocols, testing frameworks, and verification mechanisms for emergency shutdown capabilities.

## Responsibilities

1. Verification Core
   - Validate kill-switches
   - Test functionality
   - Verify operation
   - Ensure reliability

2. Framework Management
   - Control verification
   - Manage testing
   - Track status
   - Monitor health

3. System Integration
   - Connect systems
   - Verify interfaces
   - Test integration
   - Ensure coverage

## Integration Points

- Validates against policy framework (golf_00)
- Supports emergency protocols in delta_01
- Links to testing tools in delta_02
- Enables recovery in delta_03

## Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Verification: < 5ms
   - Testing: < 10ms
   - Status checks: < 3ms
   - Integration: < 15ms

2. Quality Standards
   - 100% reliability
   - Zero false negatives
   - Complete coverage
   - Perfect verification

## Success Criteria
