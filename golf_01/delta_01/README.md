# Safety Testing Infrastructure

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive testing infrastructure for validating all safety systems across the AI labscape. It provides automated test environments, validation frameworks, and verification tools.

## Responsibilities

1. Test Environment
   - Implement test containers
   - Create isolation systems
   - Develop resource management
   - Build cleanup tools

2. Kill-switch Testing
   - Design test scenarios
   - Implement activation tests
   - Create recovery validation
   - Build performance checks

3. Validation Tools
   - Implement test runners
   - Create result analyzers
   - Develop report generators
   - Build metric collectors

## Integration Points

- Tests core safety from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration testing in golf_03
- Validates all safety systems

## Testing Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Environment setup: < 1s
   - Test execution: < 100ms
   - Results analysis: < 50ms
   - Cleanup: < 500ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Isolated environments
   - Complete coverage
   - Reproducible results
   - Full audit trail

## Success Criteria

- Environments ready
- Kill-switch tested
- Tools operational
- Integration verified
- Documentation complete
