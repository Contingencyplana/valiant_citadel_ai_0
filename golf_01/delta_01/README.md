# Emergency Shutdown Protocols

## Purpose

This delta implements comprehensive emergency shutdown protocols for immediate and reliable system termination across AI operations. It provides protocol management, execution control, and verification systems.

## Responsibilities

1. Protocol Management
   - Define protocols
   - Maintain procedures
   - Update processes
   - Verify execution

2. Execution Control
   - Trigger shutdowns
   - Control sequence
   - Monitor progress
   - Verify completion

3. Emergency Response
   - Handle triggers
   - Process shutdowns
   - Track status
   - Ensure safety

## Integration Points

- Uses verification from delta_00
- Supports testing in delta_02
- Links to recovery in delta_03
- Validates against policy (golf_00)

## Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Protocol execution: < 2ms
   - Shutdown time: < 5ms
   - Status updates: < 1ms
   - Verification: < 3ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Zero failures
   - Complete shutdown
   - Full verification
   - Perfect execution

## Success Criteria

- Protocols active
- Execution verified
- Response tested
- Integration complete
- Documentation done
