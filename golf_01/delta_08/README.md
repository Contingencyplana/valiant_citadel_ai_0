# Behavioral Validation Framework

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive behavioral validation framework for AI labscape operations. It provides testing and verification of AI behavior patterns, anomaly detection, and safety boundaries.

## Responsibilities

1. Behavior Analysis
   - Implement pattern tests
   - Create behavior validators
   - Develop baseline checks
   - Build anomaly detection

2. Pattern Verification
   - Design pattern tests
   - Implement trend validation
   - Create sequence checks
   - Build correlation tests

3. Safety Boundaries
   - Implement limit testing
   - Create boundary validation
   - Develop containment checks
   - Build isolation tests

## Integration Points

- Tests behavior from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration analysis in golf_03
- Validates all AI systems

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Pattern analysis: < 50ms
   - Behavior checks: < 100ms
   - Anomaly detection: < 10ms
   - Boundary tests: < 1ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero false negatives
   - Full traceability
   - Pattern integrity

## Success Criteria

- Analysis active
- Patterns verified
- Boundaries tested
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
