# Emergency Response Testing

## Purpose

This delta implements the validation framework for testing emergency response systems across all AI labscape operations. It provides comprehensive testing of incident handling, recovery procedures, and crisis management.

## Responsibilities

1. Crisis Testing
   - Implement scenario tests
   - Create response validators
   - Develop timing checks
   - Build recovery testing

2. Response Validation
   - Design procedure tests
   - Implement action validation
   - Create coordination checks
   - Build effectiveness tests

3. Recovery Testing
   - Implement restore tests
   - Create state validation
   - Develop stability checks
   - Build verification tools

## Integration Points

- Tests emergency systems from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration response in golf_03
- Validates all safety systems

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Response tests: < 1ms
   - Recovery checks: < 100ms
   - State validation: < 50ms
   - System verify: < 10ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero failures
   - Full recovery
   - Response validation

## Success Criteria

- Crisis tests active
- Response validated
- Recovery verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
