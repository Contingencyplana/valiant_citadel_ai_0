# Infrastructure Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the comprehensive validation framework for infrastructure components across all AI labscape operations. It provides testing and verification of system integrity, service health, and component interactions.

## Responsibilities

1. System Testing
   - Implement integrity checks
   - Create health validators
   - Develop load tests
   - Build stress testing tools

2. Service Validation
   - Design service tests
   - Implement availability checks
   - Create performance tests
   - Build reliability validation

3. Component Testing
   - Implement unit tests
   - Create integration tests
   - Develop interaction checks
   - Build dependency validation

## Integration Points

- Tests infrastructure from golf_00
- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to integration testing in golf_03
- Validates all system components

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - System tests: < 500ms
   - Service checks: < 200ms
   - Component tests: < 100ms
   - Load testing: < 1s

2. Quality Standards
   - Complete coverage
   - Zero downtime
   - Full reliability
   - Component isolation

## Success Criteria

- System tests running
- Services validated
- Components verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
