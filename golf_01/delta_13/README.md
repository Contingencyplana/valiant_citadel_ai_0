# Kill-Switch Coordination System

## Purpose

This delta implements coordination and synchronization capabilities for kill-switch operations. It provides orchestration, timing control, and synchronization across all kill-switch components.

## Responsibilities

1. System Coordination
   - Sync actions
   - Time events
   - Order steps
   - Track flow

2. Event Management
   - Handle triggers
   - Control timing
   - Manage sequence
   - Track order

3. State Control
   - Monitor status
   - Manage states
   - Track changes
   - Log updates

## Integration Points

- Coordinates tools from delta_02
- Syncs with recovery in delta_03
- Uses comms from delta_12
- Reports to golf_00 policy

## Requirements

1. Performance Standards
   - Sync: < 50ms
   - Coord: < 100ms
   - Update: < 10ms
   - Log: < 5ms

2. Quality Metrics
   - Zero delays
   - Full sync
   - Perfect order
   - Complete logs

## Success Criteria

- Systems synced
- Events ordered
- States tracked
- Flow managed
- Logs complete
