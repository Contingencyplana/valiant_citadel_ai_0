# Emergency Response Systems

## Purpose

This delta implements the critical emergency response infrastructure for handling safety incidents across all AI labscape operations. It provides rapid response capabilities, containment tools, and recovery systems.

## Responsibilities

1. Incident Response
   - Implement response triggers
   - Create action pipelines
   - Develop coordination tools
   - Build tracking systems

2. Recovery Procedures
   - Design recovery plans
   - Implement restore tools
   - Create validation checks
   - Build verification systems

3. Containment Tools
   - Implement isolation systems
   - Create boundary controls
   - Develop lockdown tools
   - Build monitoring systems

## Integration Points

- Links to monitoring in golf_02
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Connects to integration response in golf_03
- Protects all safety systems

## Response Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Initial response: < 1ms
   - Containment: < 10ms
   - Recovery start: < 100ms
   - Validation: < 50ms

2. Safety Standards
   - Zero response failures
   - Complete containment
   - Full recovery
   - Total documentation

## Success Criteria

- Response systems active
- Recovery tools tested
- Containment verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
