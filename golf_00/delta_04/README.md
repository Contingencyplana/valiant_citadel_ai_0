# Resource Safety Management

## Purpose

This delta implements comprehensive resource management and safety controls for all AI labscape operations. It ensures safe allocation, monitoring, and containment of computational and system resources.

## Responsibilities

1. Resource Access Control
   - Implement access management
   - Create permission systems
   - Develop resource locks
   - Build allocation tracking

2. Safety Monitoring
   - Create usage monitors
   - Implement threshold checks
   - Develop anomaly detection
   - Establish alert systems

3. Containment Management
   - Design containment zones
   - Implement isolation controls
   - Create boundary enforcement
   - Build verification systems

## Integration Points

- Links to monitoring systems in golf_02
- Interfaces with validation in golf_01
- Connects to resource coordination in golf_03
- Supports all safety operations

## Resource Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Allocation checks: < 5ms
   - Usage validation: < 50ms
   - Containment verify: < 10ms
   - Alert generation: < 1ms

2. Safety Standards
   - 100% resource tracking
   - Zero containment breaches
   - Complete audit trails
   - Full isolation capability

## Success Criteria

- Access controls operational
- Monitoring systems active
- Containment verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
