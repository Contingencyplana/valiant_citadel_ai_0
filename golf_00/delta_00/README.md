# Core Safety Protocol Implementation

## Purpose

This delta implements the foundational safety protocol framework upon which all other safety systems are built. It provides the base validation framework, protocol verification systems, and core safety standards.

## Responsibilities

1. Safety Protocol Framework
   - Implement base safety validation architecture
   - Define core safety protocol interfaces
   - Establish protocol verification mechanisms
   - Create safety standard templates

2. Verification Systems
   - Develop protocol verification pipeline
   - Implement validation checkers
   - Create test harnesses
   - Establish verification logging

3. Safety Standards
   - Define core safety requirements
   - Establish compliance criteria
   - Create validation specifications
   - Document safety protocols

## Integration Points

- Provides base protocols for all other deltas
- Interfaces with validation systems in golf_01
- Supplies standards for monitoring in golf_02
- Defines protocols for integration in golf_03

## Success Criteria

- All core protocols implemented and verified
- Verification systems operational
- Standards documented and validated
- Integration tests passing
- Full test coverage achieved
