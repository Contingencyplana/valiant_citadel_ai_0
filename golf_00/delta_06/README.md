# Safety Gate Implementation

## Purpose

This delta implements the safety gate framework that controls and validates transitions between operational states in AI labscape systems. It ensures all safety requirements are met before allowing progression.

## Responsibilities

1. Gate Framework
   - Implement gate logic
   - Create validation rules
   - Develop state management
   - Build transition controls

2. Workflow Management
   - Create approval flows
   - Implement stage gates
   - Develop verification steps
   - Build rollback systems

3. Verification Systems
   - Design validation checks
   - Implement test suites
   - Create audit trails
   - Establish metrics

## Integration Points

- Links to validation in golf_01
- Connects to monitoring in golf_02
- Interfaces with integration gates in golf_03
- Controls all safety transitions

## Gate Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Validation: < 50ms
   - State changes: < 100ms
   - Rollback: < 200ms
   - Verification: < 10ms

2. Safety Standards
   - Zero invalid transitions
   - Complete validation
   - Full audit trails
   - Guaranteed rollback

## Success Criteria

- Gate framework active
- Workflows validated
- Verification complete
- Integration tested
- Documentation finalized
