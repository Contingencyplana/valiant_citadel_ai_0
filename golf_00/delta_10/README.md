# Safety Infrastructure

## Purpose

This delta implements the core infrastructure services and components that support all safety operations across the AI labscape. It provides the foundational systems for safety service deployment, monitoring, and management.

## Responsibilities

1. Core Services
   - Implement service framework
   - Create deployment systems
   - Develop scaling tools
   - Build management interfaces

2. Infrastructure Monitoring
   - Design health checks
   - Implement performance tracking
   - Create alerting systems
   - Build diagnostic tools

3. Resource Management
   - Implement allocation systems
   - Create capacity planning
   - Develop optimization tools
   - Build scaling mechanisms

## Integration Points

- Supports monitoring in golf_02
- Links to validation in golf_01
- Connects to integration infrastructure in golf_03
- Underlies all safety systems

## Infrastructure Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Service deployment: < 1s
   - Health checks: < 100ms
   - Resource allocation: < 50ms
   - Scaling operations: < 5s

2. Safety Standards
   - 99.999% uptime
   - Zero service gaps
   - Complete monitoring
   - Full redundancy

## Success Criteria

- Services operational
- Monitoring active
- Resources managed
- Integration verified
- Documentation complete
