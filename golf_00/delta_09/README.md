# Safety Control Systems

## Purpose

This delta implements the operational control systems that manage and enforce safety constraints across all AI labscape operations. It provides comprehensive control mechanisms, override capabilities, and intervention tools.

## Responsibilities

1. Control Mechanisms
   - Implement control interfaces
   - Create constraint systems
   - Develop enforcement tools
   - Build validation checks

2. Override Systems
   - Design override protocols
   - Implement authorization
   - Create audit trails
   - Build safety interlocks

3. Intervention Tools
   - Implement emergency controls
   - Create intervention triggers
   - Develop response actions
   - Build recovery systems

## Integration Points

- Links to monitoring in golf_02
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Connects to integration controls in golf_03
- Controls all safety systems

## Control Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Control response: < 5ms
   - Override activation: < 10ms
   - Intervention: < 1ms
   - Validation: < 50ms

2. Safety Standards
   - Zero unauthorized overrides
   - Complete control coverage
   - Full audit capability
   - Guaranteed intervention

## Success Criteria

- Control systems active
- Override mechanisms tested
- Intervention tools verified
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
