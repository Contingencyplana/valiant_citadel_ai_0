# Safety Intelligence Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements the intelligence validation framework for analyzing and ensuring the safety of AI behaviors and patterns. It provides comprehensive tools for behavior analysis, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.

## Responsibilities

1. Behavior Analysis
   - Implement analysis engines
   - Create pattern detectors
   - Develop baseline models
   - Build validation tools

2. Pattern Recognition
   - Design recognition systems
   - Implement learning models
   - Create classification tools
   - Build trend analysis

3. Anomaly Detection
   - Implement detection algorithms
   - Create alert systems
   - Develop response triggers
   - Build validation checks

## Integration Points

- Links to monitoring in golf_02
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Connects to integration analytics in golf_03
- Informs all safety systems

## Intelligence Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Analysis speed: < 10ms
   - Pattern matching: < 50ms
   - Anomaly detection: < 5ms
