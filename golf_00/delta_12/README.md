# External Safety Integration

## Purpose

This delta implements the integration framework for connecting safety systems with external components and third-party systems. It provides secure, validated interfaces for cross-system safety operations.

## Responsibilities

1. Integration Validation
   - Implement interface checks
   - Create protocol validation
   - Develop security testing
   - Build compliance tools

2. Cross-System Safety
   - Design safety bridges
   - Implement verification
   - Create monitoring tools
   - Build isolation systems

3. External Communication
   - Implement secure channels
   - Create protocol adapters
   - Develop filtering systems
   - Build validation checks

## Integration Points

- Coordinates with monitoring in golf_02
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Links to integration hub in golf_03
- Connects all external systems

## Integration Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Interface checks: < 50ms
   - Protocol validation: < 100ms
   - Communication: < 10ms
   - Security verify: < 5ms

2. Safety Standards
   - Zero security gaps
   - Complete isolation
   - Full validation
   - Secure channels

## Success Criteria

- Integration active
- Validation complete
- Communication secure
- Systems connected
- Documentation finalized
