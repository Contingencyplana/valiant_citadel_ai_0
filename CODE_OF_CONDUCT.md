# Toyfoundry Code of Conduct

Toyfoundry maintains a collaborative manufacturing ecosystem where doctrine authors, automation engineers, and toysoldier operators work together to deliver safe, joyful creations. This Code of Conduct sets expectations for behaviour across repositories, documentation, meetings, and synced exchanges.

## Our Standards

Participants agree to uphold the following principles:

- Foster a welcoming, respectful environment for people of every background, identity, and experience level.
- Prioritize safety and containment in every production decision, raising concerns immediately when risk boundaries are unclear.
- Share credit generously and document contributions so the manufacturing record remains transparent and auditable.
- Offer constructive feedback that focuses on ideas and processes rather than individuals.
- Honour confidentiality requirements for exchange payloads, ledger updates, and manufacturing telemetry.

## Unacceptable Behaviour

Toyfoundry prohibits:

- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments in any channel.
- Negligent handling of safety rails, governance collateral, or production data.
- Sabotage of tooling, automation, or exchange integrations.
- Knowingly introducing malicious code or bypassing quality gates.

## Scope

This Code applies to all Toyfoundry spaces, including:

- Repository issues, pull requests, and code reviews.
- Planning documents and doctrine scrolls.
- Automation scripts, tooling discussions, and incident reports.
- Shared exchange channels, synchronous meetings, and community forums.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness a violation:

1. Document the behaviour, including dates, channels, and participants.
2. Contact the Toyfoundry governance stewards via the exchange or designated email channel.
3. When appropriate, escalate to High Command governance for cross-theatre coordination.

Reports are handled confidentially. Retaliation for a report is itself a violation.

## Enforcement

Governance stewards will review incidents promptly and determine an appropriate response. Actions may include clarification meetings, written warnings, suspension of repository access, or removal from the project. Severe, repeated, or intentional violations may be escalated to High Command leadership.

By participating in Toyfoundry, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct and help cultivate a respectful, safety-first manufacturing culture.
