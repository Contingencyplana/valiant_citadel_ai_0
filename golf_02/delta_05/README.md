# Pipeline Flow Control

## Purpose

This delta implements safety-critical pipeline flow control mechanisms to ensure safe and controlled execution of AI operations in the labscape. It manages data flow, execution pacing, and runtime control.

## Responsibilities

1. Flow Management
   - Control data streams
   - Manage execution pace
   - Monitor throughput
   - Balance workloads

2. Pipeline Control
   - Implement checkpoints
   - Create gates
   - Build flow metrics
   - Develop control tools

3. Safety Oversight
   - Monitor flow safety
   - Check data integrity
   - Track operations
   - Build safety tools

## Integration Points

- Controls flow from golf_00
- Validates with golf_01
- Links to golf_03
- Manages all pipelines

## Control Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Flow control: < 1ms
   - Safety checks: < 5ms
   - Gate operations: < 2ms
   - Monitoring: < 10ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Zero data loss
   - Complete control
   - Full visibility
   - Perfect safety

## Success Criteria

- Flow controlled
- Safety assured
- Operations tracked
- Integration done
- Docs complete
