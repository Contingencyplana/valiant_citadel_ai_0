# Runtime Safety Validation

## Purpose

This delta implements runtime safety validation mechanisms to ensure continuous safety checks and validation during AI system execution. It provides real-time validation, safety assertions, and runtime checks.

## Responsibilities

1. Runtime Validation
   - Check safety rules
   - Monitor execution
   - Validate operations
   - Track compliance

2. Safety Assertions
   - Build test suite
   - Create checkers
   - Implement proofs
   - Design validators

3. Execution Control
   - Monitor runtime
   - Control flow
   - Check safety
   - Manage execution

## Integration Points

- Validates golf_00
- Links to golf_01
- Supports golf_03
- Monitors all systems

## Validation Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Safety checks: < 1ms
   - Validation: < 5ms
   - Monitoring: < 2ms
   - Control: < 10ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Full coverage
   - Zero misses
   - Complete logs
   - Perfect tracking

## Success Criteria

- Validation active
- Safety assured
- Runtime controlled
- Integration complete
- Documentation done
