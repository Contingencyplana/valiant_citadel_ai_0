# Real-time Safety Analysis

## Purpose

This delta implements the real-time analysis systems for safety monitoring across all AI labscape operations. It provides comprehensive tone assessment, entropy monitoring, and behavioral analysis capabilities.

## Responsibilities

1. Tone Assessment
   - Implement tone analyzers
   - Create pattern matching
   - Develop trend analysis
   - Build alert systems

2. Entropy Monitoring
   - Design entropy metrics
   - Implement chaos detection
   - Create stability checks
   - Build threshold alerts

3. Behavior Analysis
   - Implement pattern detection
   - Create anomaly identification
   - Develop risk assessment
   - Build prediction models

## Integration Points

- Analyzes core safety from golf_00
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Links to integration analysis in golf_03
- Monitors all AI systems

## Analysis Requirements

1. Performance Metrics
   - Tone analysis: < 1ms
   - Entropy checks: < 5ms
   - Pattern detection: < 10ms
   - Alert generation: < 1ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Zero false negatives
   - Real-time processing
   - Complete coverage
   - Full accuracy

## Success Criteria

- Analysis running
- Patterns detected
- Alerts functional
- Integration verified
- Documentation complete
