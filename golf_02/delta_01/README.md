# Entropy Monitoring Tools

## Purpose

This delta implements comprehensive tools for monitoring and measuring entropy in AI systems. It provides real-time entropy assessment, pattern analysis, and variance detection capabilities.

## Responsibilities

1. Entropy Monitoring
   - Track variance
   - Measure chaos
   - Assess patterns
   - Monitor flow

2. Tool Management
   - Run checks
   - Update tools
   - Track status
   - Log results

3. Data Analysis
   - Process metrics
   - Find patterns
   - Spot anomalies
   - Generate insights

## Integration Points

- Uses framework from delta_00
- Supports protocols in delta_02
- Feeds alerts to delta_03
- Reports to golf_00 policy

## Requirements
