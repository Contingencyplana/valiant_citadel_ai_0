# Performance Optimization System

## Purpose

This delta implements performance monitoring and optimization for tone and entropy assessment systems. It provides system tuning, resource management, and performance tracking across all components.

## Responsibilities

1. Performance Monitoring
   - Track metrics
   - Monitor speed
   - Check resources
   - Log status

2. System Optimization
   - Tune components
   - Adjust settings
   - Improve flow
   - Track gains

3. Resource Management
   - Allocate resources
   - Balance load
   - Handle peaks
   - Monitor usage

## Integration Points
