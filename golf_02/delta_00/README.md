# Monitoring Core Implementation

## Purpose

This delta implements the foundational monitoring infrastructure for all AI labscape operations. It provides the core framework for real-time data collection, analysis, and alert generation across all safety systems.

## Responsibilities

1. Monitoring Framework
   - Implement collection core
   - Create analysis pipeline
   - Develop alert system
   - Build orchestration tools

2. Data Collection
   - Design collection agents
   - Implement aggregation
   - Create filtering systems
   - Build processing pipeline

3. Monitoring Orchestration
   - Implement coordination
   - Create scheduling system
   - Develop load balancing
   - Build failover mechanisms

## Integration Points

- Monitors core safety from golf_00
- Supports validation in golf_01
- Links to integration monitoring in golf_03
- Oversees all safety systems

## Performance Requirements

1. Collection Metrics
   - Data ingestion: < 1ms
   - Processing time: < 10ms
   - Alert generation: < 5ms
   - Analysis: < 50ms

2. Quality Standards
   - Zero data loss
   - Complete coverage
   - Real-time processing
   - Full reliability

## Success Criteria

- Collection active
- Processing operational
- Alerts functioning
- Integration complete
- Documentation finalized
