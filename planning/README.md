# Valiant Citadel Planning

Purpose: Organize safety work (policies, gates, monitoring, incident readiness) and keep it scoped to this workspace.

Contents
- ROADMAP.md — 30/60/90 plan across core safety tracks
- TRIAGE.md — What to adapt/retire from inherited planning docs
- templates/safety_initiative.md — One-pager template for scoped initiatives

Working Agreements
- Safety-first scope: planning here must map to gates, watcher signals, runbooks, or policies
- Change-as-order: risky changes ship through the exchange as orders with gates
- Dual-key: freeze/rollback/policy changes require distinct approvals
- Measurable outcomes: every initiative has acceptance checks tied to monitoring
