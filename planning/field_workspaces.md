# ⚔️ field_workspaces.md — The Front-Line Laboratories of SHAGI  
*Planning Scroll — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll defines the **Field Workspaces** of SHAGI — the *living laboratories* where Toysoldiers and Wits engage directly with the terrain of emergence.  

If `high_command_ai_0` represents **thought and deliberation**,  
then each Field Workspace (e.g., `toysoldiers_ai_0`, `making_friends_0`, `music_maker_thorn_0`) represents **action and experimentation**.  

Together, they form the **reflex arc** of SHAGI:  
> *High Command dreams — Field Workspaces act.*

Each Field Workspace is structured identically to High Command,  
but its Alfas are **battlefields**, not **war-rooms**.  
They play, evolve, and send reports upward to guide the Great Daylands.

## ⚙️ 1. Geometry of a Battlefield (Alfa)

| Element | Symbolic Role | Implementation Idea |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Battlefield Grid (16×16)** | Terrain of ideas | A 2-D array of cells representing symbolic forces (light, void, growth, emotion, structure). |
| **Terrain Cells** | The living atoms of creativity | Each cell holds a state (Dayland/Nightland) and a symbolic glyph. |
| **Battlefield JSON** | Memory of battle | Stores emergent metrics, entropy index, and last report results. |
| **Toysoldiers** | Agents of play and repair | Move across the grid, interact, and shift terrain states through rules and chance. |

Each Alfa in the field is a **self-contained surreal microgame** —  
a fragment of thought rendered in play.

## 🌈 2. Roles of Terrain Types

| Symbol | Element | Behaviour | Meaning |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| 🌕 | Light | Expands through harmony and clarity | Represents discovery and understanding |
| 🕳️ | Void | Consumes unstable terrain | Represents entropy and ignorance |
| 🌿 | Growth | Spreads through interaction | Represents creativity and regeneration |
| ⚙️ | Structure | Stabilises nearby cells | Represents order, logic, and architecture |
| 🜛 | Emotion | Fluctuates with player or AI mood | Represents vitality and empathy |

The interplay of these symbols creates the *psychogeography* of the battlefield —  
a constantly shifting dream-map of the player’s and AI’s minds.

## 🔄 3. Lifecycle of a Battle

1. **Initialization Phase**  
   Terrain is seeded from templates or previous victories.  
   Each cell receives a state and symbol.

2. **Engagement Phase**  
   Toysoldiers act: they move, build, sing, or dissolve Nightlands through interaction.

3. **Resolution Phase**  
   Patterns stabilize or collapse; entropy is recalculated.

4. **Reporting Phase**  
   A concise report is written to JSON:

```json
   {
     "realm": "Dayland",
     "entropy_index": 0.41,
     "victory": true,
     "casualties": 3,
     "duration_ticks": 64
   }
```

### 5. Transmission Phase

The report is zipped and sent to `high_command_ai_0/inbox/` for deliberation.

## ☀️ 4. Daylands vs Nightlands

| Realm | Meaning | Condition | Action |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Dayland** | Emergent, balanced, creative | Entropy < 0.5 | Battlefield remains active |
| **Nightland** | Decayed, stagnant, corrupted | Entropy ≥ 0.5 | Quarantined for repair or rebirth |

Daylands are sources of light — playable, generative worlds.  
Nightlands are not deleted; they become **enemy realms**, where future Toysoldiers are sent to restore harmony.

---

## 🪖 5. Early Toysoldier Archetypes

| Archetype | Core Trait | Primary Function |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Scout** | Exploration | Moves quickly, maps new terrain, detects Nightlands. |
| **Builder** | Creation | Repairs terrain, builds structure (⚙️) and growth (🌿). |
| **Healer** | Restoration | Lowers entropy through song or empathy (🜛). |
| **Wanderer** | Curiosity | Roams freely; spreads randomness that triggers evolution. |

Later archetypes may emerge from hybrids of these four foundations.

## 🧮 6. Report Structure (Summary)

Each Field Alfa produces a JSON report in this format:

```json
{
  "id": "alfa_024",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.41,
  "terrain_balance": {
    "light": 67,
    "void": 14,
    "growth": 40,
    "structure": 89,
    "emotion": 56
  },
  "victory": true,
  "casualties": 3,
  "ticks": 64,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T21:00Z"
}
```

These reports are aggregated upward through the rank structure,  
culminating in High Command’s strategic deliberations.

## 🚀 7. Phased Growth Path

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | One Golf (16×16 = 256 battlefields) | Establish core gameplay loop and reporting pipeline. |
| **Phase 2** | Four Golfs (~1,000 battlefields) | Introduce Toysoldier archetypes and inter-battle communication. |
| **Phase 3** | Full Juliett (4,096 battlefields) | Achieve emergent AI play and autonomous learning ecosystems. |

---

## 🌄 8. Closing Principle

> **Every battlefield is a story.**  
> **Every story teaches the army how to dream.**  
> In the play of light and shadow,  
> *the Field Workspaces remember what the High Command imagines.*
