## The Seven Pivotal Fronts

### Front 1: Tons of Fun (Game Design & Balance)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/tons_of_fun.md`

**Focus:** Balance, economy, anti-exploit gates, player retention

### Front 2: Safety (AI Safety & Containment)

**Purpose:** Prevent catastrophic outcomes; contain unsafe trajectories  
**Focus:** Kill-switches, dual-key approvals, incident response

### Front 3: Documentation (Clarity & Standards)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/docs.md`  
**Purpose:** Make doctrine clear, parseable, actionable for humans and AI  
**Focus:** Templates, schemas, safety notes, stable headings

### Front 4: R&D (Research & Development)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/r_and_d.md`  
**Purpose:** Advance SHAGI capabilities while maintaining safety  
**Focus:** Experiments, proposals, innovation within safety gates

### Front 5: Manufacturing (Toyfoundry)
**File:** `planning/pivotal_fronts/manufacturing.md`  
**Purpose:** Build and validate toy units via Forge/Parade/Purge/Promote rituals  
**Focus:** Production pipelines, telemetry, quality gates

### Front 6: Field Ops (Toysoldiers)

## Guiding Principles

1. **One canon, many implementers** â€” Satellites link back; no drift
2. **Changes travel via Exchange** â€” Orders/acknowledgements/reports for all changes
3. **Safety gates guard promotions** â€” Proposal â†’ sandbox â†’ canary â†’ GA
4. **Fronts coordinate, don't compete** â€” Shared telemetry, unified doctrine

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Telemetry & Monitoring
- **Quilt Loom:** `tools/quilt_loom.py` â€” Aggregates factory-reports
- **Watcher:** `tools/ci/safety_watcher.ps1` â€” Scans for violations
- **Ledger:** `exchange/ledger/` â€” Order lifecycle tracking

### Playable Workflow Overlay (New)
- **Four Major Pivots:** `new_major_pivots/README.md`
- **Alfa Zero Spec:** `docs/alfa_zero_spec.md`
- **Fractal Structure:** `golf_00/` through `golf_15/` (4,096 Alfas)

### Core Infrastructure
- **Exchange Protocol:** `exchange/README.md`
- **Schema Validator:** `tools/schema_validator.py`
- **Forge Automation:** Planning scroll reference
