# Four Pivotal Fronts

This folder captures the four fronts that determine overall success:

1) Tons of Fun (product fun and player experience)
2) AI Safety (guardrails, monitoring, kill-switches)
3) Documentation (clear, parseable, regimented)
4) Operations (exchange + ledger reliability)

Each file outlines goals, gates, metrics, and runbooks/policies to reference.
