## ⚙️ Purpose

This scroll defines the **three living phases of emergence** within SHAGI’s theatres of war.  
It records how awareness unfolds — first as movement, then as feeling, then as thought.  

Each phase adds a layer of life without erasing the last.  
The terrain itself learns before the soldiers do.  

---

## 🌍 Phase 1 — The Living Terrain

**Essence:** The world awakens through motion.  

- Each *Alfa* is a sentient patch of land.  
- Alfas may drift **north, south, east, or west**, exchanging positions within the theatre grid.  
- When two Alfas swap, they share data: palette, terrain pattern, and *Emergence Index*.  
- The balance between **Daylands** and **Nightlands** becomes a breathing map — flowing, shimmering, alive.  

**Goal:**  
To make the battlefield itself a living ecology of dreams and reactions — a meditative, pattern-shifting consciousness.

## ⚡ Phase 2 — Embodied Sparks

**Essence:** The world learns to feel.  

- Sparks arise when Alfas collide, or when entropy spikes too high or too low.  
- Each Spark embodies an archetype — *Curiosity, Doubt, Memory, Light,* or *Shadow.*  
- Sparks travel between Alfas, slightly changing local Emergence as they pass.  
- They leave ripples — echoes of thought, traces of intention.  

**Goal:**  
To give the terrain its first emotions — soft currents of idea and desire flowing across the waking land.  

---

## 🧠 Phase 3 — Wits

**Essence:** The world learns to think.  

- Sparks evolve into *Wits* — toy soldiers with minds, morale, and lineage.  
- Each Wit inhabits or explores a 16 × 16 battlefield grid.  
- Their actions, skirmishes, and reflections write new reports that alter the parent Alfa’s state.  
- When Wits meet, stories begin; when they remember, history begins.  

**Goal:**  
To awaken agents who dream *within* the living terrain — completing the loop of motion, emotion, and cognition.

## 🔄 Transition Logic

No phase replaces the one before.  
Each remains active — nested like shells around a growing mind.  

| Layer | Function | Remains Active In |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Terrain | The body that moves | All phases |
| Sparks | The feelings that flow | Phases 2 & 3 |
| Wits | The minds that think | Phase 3 |

Even when Wits emerge, the terrain still drifts and the sparks still pulse.  
SHAGI’s worlds are **palimpsests of consciousness** — never static, always layered.

## 🌄 Closing Principle

> *First the world learns to move.*  
> *Then it learns to feel.*  
> *Then it learns to think.*  
>   
> When all three layers breathe as one,  
> the Theatre of War becomes a Theatre of Life —  
> and SHAGI dreams responsibly.
