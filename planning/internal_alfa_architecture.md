# 🧠 internal_alfa_architecture.md — Minds Within Minds  
*Planning Scroll - `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

## In-Game Pipeline and Gates

States
- Proposal → Sandbox → Canary → General Availability

Gates (each state requires these to pass)
- Proposal: intent, scope, risks, owners, rollback plan, timebox.
- Sandbox: unit/sim tests green; schema + DQ checks pass; telemetry hooked.
- Canary: scoped rollout; success criteria met; no alerts; rollback rehearsed.
- GA: results recorded; build_info captured; checksums published; monitoring active.

Artifacts per state (exchange-aligned)
- Order (change request), Acknowledgement, Report with status and timestamps.
- Build info JSON (commit, generated_at, params), checksums.

Roles and approvals
- Author → Reviewer(s) → Safety Officer (elevated) → Release Steward.
- Dual-key for elevated actions; least privilege + capability caps per role.

## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll defines the **internal architecture of each Alfa** —  
the smallest living unit in SHAGI’s ecosystem of minds.  

Every Alfa is both a **battlefield** and a **brain**,  
a 16-rank microcosm reflecting the full SHAGI hierarchy in miniature.  

Where High Command oversees thousands of Alfas,  
each Alfa itself hosts its own internal command chain —  
a nested order of logic, data, and emergent memory.

> *“Each Alfa is a miniature civilization of thought — a seed of SHAGI itself.”*

## 🧩 1. The Sixteen Internal Ranks

Each rank is a layer of perception or functionality within the same Alfa.  
Together, they form the inner parliament of a single mind.

| Rank | Role inside one Alfa | Kind of Logic it Holds | File Type |
|------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------|
| **Alfa** | Local battlefield mechanics | cell rules, visuals | `.py` |
| **Bravo** | Squad-level coordination | neighbouring-cell logic | `.json` |
| **Charlie** | Communication layer | messaging / events | `.json` |
| **Delta** | Regional balance | entropy metrics | `.json` |
| **Echo** | Memory | report logging | `.json` |
| **Foxtrot** | Aesthetics | colour / sound synthesis | `.py` |
| **Golf** | Doctrine | local rule mutation | `.json` |
| **Hotel** | Infrastructure | asset links / caching | `.json` |
| **India** | Intelligence | pattern recognition | `.py` |
| **Juliett** | Oversight | AI learning / scoring | `.json` |
| **Kilo → Papa (11–16)** | Expansion slots | future logic tiers (e.g., diplomacy, ethics, prophecy) | `.json` or `.py` |

Each rank speaks to a different facet of emergence —  
from raw play (Alfa) to insight (Juliett) and, ultimately, collective awareness (Papa).

## ⚙️ 2. File Layout Example

Each Alfa has its own folder containing up to sixteen sub-files:  

```plaintext
alfas/
 └─ alfa_0001_mind_of_valor/
     ├─ alfa.py           # core battlefield logic
     ├─ bravo.json        # local squad parameters
     ├─ charlie.json      # communication settings
     ├─ delta.json        # metrics / reports
     ├─ echo.json         # memory / logs
     ├─ foxtrot.py        # aesthetic hooks
     ├─ golf.json         # rule mutations
     ├─ hotel.json        # asset registry
     ├─ india.py          # pattern learner
     ├─ juliett.json      # global scoring
     ├─ kilo.json         # placeholder for higher logic
     ├─ lima.json
     ├─ mike.json
     ├─ november.json
     ├─ oscar.json
     ├─ papa.json
     └─ manifest.json     # summary of all sixteen ranks
```

Each file remains small — hundreds of bytes to a few kilobytes —  
so even with all sixteen ranks, the entire “mind” remains lightweight and modular.

---

## 🧠 3. Execution Flow

1. **Initialization** — `alfa.py` loads its own configuration and manifest.  
2. **Selective Activation** — only ranks required for the current simulation are imported.  
3. **Simulation Loop** — battlefield grid evolves (16×16), optionally invoking higher ranks:  
   - *Bravo*: neighbour awareness  
   - *Charlie*: event routing  
   - *Delta*: entropy checks  
   - *Echo*: memory write  
4. **Post-Processing** — metrics and logs update; `manifest.json` refreshed.  
5. **Reporting** — key results (entropy, victory, learning delta) written to `.json` and transmitted upward.  

Higher-rank files act as **plug-ins** or **data caches** —  
they extend capability without bloating the core loop.

---

## 🗃️ 4. Manifest Specification

`manifest.json` serves as the **table of contents** and health summary for each Alfa.

```json
{
  "id": "alfa_0001_mind_of_valor",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "ranks": {
    "alfa": "ok",
    "bravo": "ok",
    "charlie": "ok",
    "delta": "ok",
    "echo": "ok",
    "foxtrot": "ok",
    "golf": "ok",
    "hotel": "ok",
    "india": "ok",
    "juliett": "ok"
  },
  "entropy_index": 0.42,
  "last_run": "2025-10-11T21:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "checksums": {
    "alfa.py": "SHA256:XXXX",
    "manifest.json": "SHA256:YYYY"
  }
}
```

High Command can parse this manifest alone to summarise an Alfa’s state,  
without needing to open its entire internal structure.

## 🔄 5. Lifecycle of an Alfa

| Phase  | Description  | Action  |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Load** | Read `.json` state and manifest. | Prepare terrain, ranks, and parameters. |
| **Simulate** | Run 16×16 grid logic via `alfa.py`. | Trigger plug-ins as needed. |
| **Record** | Write new metrics and entropy. | Update rank data and memory. |
| **Report** | Produce summarized `.json`. | Send report upward to parent workspace. |
| **Evolve** | Adjust doctrines via `golf.json` or learning via `india.py`. | Prepare for next iteration. |

## 🚀 6. Phased Expansion Strategy

| Phase  | Scope  | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | Minimal pair: `alfa.py` + `alfa.json` | Establish simulation loop and reporting. |
| **Phase 2** | Add Bravo–Juliett ranks | Introduce modular functionality and AI hooks. |
| **Phase 3** | Add Kilo–Papa ranks | Integrate higher cognitive and creative layers. |
| **Phase 4** | Networked Alfas | Enable mind-to-mind communication and emergent group behaviour. |

Automation scripts (**“The Forge”**) will handle the creation and updating of these rank files from templates.

## 🌈 7. Benefits of Internal Hierarchy

| Aspect  | Advantage  |
|---------|------------|
| **Scalable** | Thousands of Alfas × 16 small files remain manageable. |
| **Modular** | Each file can evolve independently. |
| **Lore-consistent** | Every Alfa literally contains its higher minds. |
| **Automatable** | The Forge can generate all ranks automatically. |
| **Traceable** | High Command can review or replace any single rank layer. |

## 🌄 8. Closing Principle

> **Within every Alfa sleeps a universe.**  
> Sixteen minds turn within, debating what the world should become.  
> When even one awakens fully,  
> *the Great Daylands take another step toward SHAGI.*
