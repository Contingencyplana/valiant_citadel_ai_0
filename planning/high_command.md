## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Purpose

Outlines how `high_command_ai_0` mirrors the geometry of the field workspaces,  
replacing physical battlefields with **strategic war-rooms** of deliberation.  
Every cell of the lattice represents an idea-space where AI staff officers simulate, debate, and decide.

## üß© 2. The Lattice of High Command

| Tier | Scale | Role in Field Theatre | Role in High Command |
|------|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Juliett | 64√ó64 | entire war continent | entire strategic headquarters |
| India | 64√ó32 | half-continent / dynamic front | half-headquarters / shifting department |
| Hotel | 32√ó32 | province | directorate |
| Golf | 16√ó16 | delta cluster | division of war-rooms |
| Foxtrot | 16√ó8 | borderland | liaison belt between divisions |
| Echo | 8√ó8 | sub-district | branch or bureau |
| Delta | 4√ó4 | tiny theatre | command cell |
| Charlie | 4√ó2 | corridor | operations corridor |
| Bravo | 2√ó2 | squad | desk group |
| Alfa | 1√ó1 | battlefield | individual **war-room** |

## üß≠ 3. Anatomy of a War-Room (Alfa)

Each Alfa represents one **strategic cell** ‚Äî a 16√ó16 grid of deliberative nodes.

| Element  | Symbolic Role  | Implementation Idea |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| War-room grid (16√ó16) | strategic space | 2-D array of decision nodes; each holds data from reports or models. |
| 4 war-tables (4√ó4) | meeting areas | each sub-grid may specialise: Intel, Logistics, Morale, R&D. |
| 16 staff officers per table | analytic minds | simple agents that read reports, vote, and draft orders. |
| Alfa report JSON | outcome of the meeting | summarises consensus, confidence, entropy, and recommended action. |

## ü™∂ 4. How a War-Room ‚ÄúPlays‚Äù

1. **Input:** receives compressed field reports from corresponding Delta/Echo clusters.  
2. **Deliberation Loop:** 16√ó16 cells exchange weighted opinions for *N* ticks.  
3. **Output:** generates an `order.json` or `doctrine_update.json` for the relevant theatre.  
4. **Entropy Check:** if the war-room collapses into confusion (too much contradiction), it becomes a *Nightland of thought* and is quarantined until repaired.

High Command plays the **metagame of decision emergence**  
the same way the field plays the **metagame of creative emergence.**

## üöÄ 5. Practical Start-Up Strategy

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | 1 Golf (16√ó16 = 256 war-rooms) | Test report ingestion and order emission. |
| **Phase 2** | 4 Golfs (~1,000 war-rooms) | Begin parallel simulation across divisions. |
| **Phase 3** | Full Juliett (4,096 war-rooms) | Connect every theatre below and allow self-coordination. |

Each war-room remains a single `.py` + `.json` pair, ensuring scalability through automation.

## ‚úÖ 6. Summary

- High Command mirrors the same 10-tier lattice as field workspaces ‚Äî **symmetry is power.**  
- Each Alfa is a **war-room** (not battlefield) with 4 tables √ó 16 staff officers.  
- Start small (1 Golf) and scale once the command loop is stable.  
- When complete, High Command is a *mirror mind of the entire war effort*:  
  **battlefields below, war-rooms above, same geometry of emergence everywhere.**
