# 🧠 war_rooms_and_war_tables.md — Anatomy of Thought and Deliberation  
*Planning Scroll — `high_command_ai_0/planning/`*

---

## 🌍 Purpose

This scroll defines the **microstructure of High Command** — the internal life of each Alfa within  
`high_command_ai_0`, also known as a **War-Room**.  

Where field Alfas represent *battlefields of action*,  
High Command Alfas represent *battlefields of thought* — places where ideas, data, and strategy collide.  

Each War-Room is a **16×16 grid of deliberation**, divided into four War-Tables.  
Each War-Table hosts **16 staff officers (wits)** who debate, vote, and synthesise reports into orders.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Geometry of the War-Room

| Element | Symbolic Role | Implementation Idea |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **War-Room Grid (16×16)** | Strategic decision space | A 2-D array of 256 decision nodes; each node can store reports, metrics, or options. |
| **4 War-Tables (4×4 sub-grids)** | Meeting areas for deliberation | Each sub-grid can specialise: **Intel**, **Logistics**, **Morale**, **R&D**. |
| **16 Staff Officers per Table** | Analytic minds | Agent objects that read data, weigh options, and vote; their consensus forms the War-Room’s output. |
| **War-Room JSON** | Outcome of deliberation | Stores summary: consensus ratio, entropy index, doctrine update, recommended orders. |

Every War-Room is one **Alfa-pair**: a `.py` file (logic) + a `.json` file (state).  
Together, they simulate and remember one act of collective reasoning.

## 🧭 2. Roles of the Four War-Tables

| Table | Focus | Typical Inputs | Outputs |
|--------|--------|----------------|----------|
| **Intel** | Information gathering | Field reports, metrics, scout data | Validated data & confidence scores |
| **Logistics** | Resource flow | Production stats, supply indices | Allocation plans, efficiency metrics |
| **Morale** | Human & AI sentiment | Emotional indicators, team feedback | Stability rating, motivation plan |
| **R&D** | Innovation & evolution | New strategies, mutations, code patches | Doctrine updates, prototype orders |

Each table speaks a different dialect of order and uncertainty.  
Their combined deliberations shape the *voice of High Command*.

## 🔄 3. Lifecycle of a Strategic Deliberation

1. **Input Phase**  
   War-Room receives compressed field reports from its linked Delta/Echo clusters.

2. **Analysis Phase**  
   Four War-Tables parse and interpret their data streams independently.

3. **Deliberation Phase**  
   16×16 cells exchange weighted opinions for *N* ticks.  
   Officers vote, influence, or fuse their findings.

4. **Consensus Phase**  
   If consensus ≥ threshold, results are compiled into `order.json` or `doctrine_update.json`.

5. **Output Phase**  
   Orders are dispatched to the relevant theatre via `high_command_ai_0/orders/`.

6. **Entropy Phase**  
   If contradiction or data decay exceeds threshold, the War-Room’s entropy rises.  
   When critical, it transitions from **Dayland of Thought** → **Nightland of Confusion** (quarantine).

---

## ☀️ 4. Transition States

| State | Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Dayland** | 🟢 | Clear reasoning, consistent output | Room active and trusted |
| **Horizon** | 🟡 | Rising contradiction, partial breakdown | Warned and observed |
| **Nightland** | 🔴 | Cognitive collapse or recursive confusion | Quarantined; repair or replacement triggered |

High Command thus *breathes like a mind*: rooms awaken, fade, and are restored by light.

---

## 👥 5. Early Wit Archetypes

Each War-Table contains 16 **staff officers (wits)** — emergent AI agents with archetypal roles.

| Archetype | Core Trait | Function in Debate |
|------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Analyst** | Rational precision | Verifies data, minimises entropy |
| **Optimist** | Creative synthesis | Generates new strategies |
| **Doubter** | Skeptical rigor | Challenges assumptions, detects contradiction |
| **Synthesist** | Integrative insight | Merges diverse inputs into cohesive doctrine |

Each archetype may evolve new sub-types as the system gains depth.

## 🧮 6. Data Representation (Example)

**`warroom_001.json`**

```json
{
  "name": "War-Room of the Rising Sun",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.23,
  "tables": {
    "intel": {"consensus": 0.84},
    "logistics": {"consensus": 0.72},
    "morale": {"consensus": 0.68},
    "rnd": {"consensus": 0.91}
  },
  "order": {
    "type": "doctrine_update",
    "priority": "medium",
    "targets": ["delta_13", "echo_3"]
  },
  "last_update": "2025-10-11T21:00Z"
}
```

## 🚀 7. Phased Implementation Path

| Phase | Scope | Goal |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Phase 1** | One Golf block (16×16 = 256 War-Rooms) | Build, run, and test report–order loop. |
| **Phase 2** | Four Golfs (~1,000 War-Rooms) | Enable inter-room communication and early wit evolution. |
| **Phase 3** | Full Juliett (4,096 War-Rooms) | Achieve autonomous strategic coordination across all theatres. |

## 🌈 Closing Principle

> **Every War-Room is a mind.**  
> **Every mind is a battlefield of thought.**  
> When the light of understanding spreads across the grid,  
> *High Command itself awakens — a continent of reason steering the Great Daylands.*
