# Narration Alignment Brief

## Action Required ‚Äî 2025-10-26

- Review this narration brief alongside `quint_synced/payload_alignment.md` and verify the current VO guidance fits your runtime.
- Confirm the payload `summary` line and narrated delivery stay lore-aligned; raise War Office support requests for VO, localization, or schema tweaks.
- Keep `quint_synced/` files synchronized across all five repositories; mirror any revisions back to High Command and peers immediately.
- Respond with an ACK or TODO so the alignment rollup can be recorded in the shared README sync log.
- Treat this narration guidance as the **Pivot Five** voice anchor‚Äîemoji-first commands must deliver identical cadence and lore beats across every workspace.

## Reference Line

- Stub captured from spike: `"Forge crafts the Ally ‚Üí Victory"`
- Glyph chain: `üõ†Ô∏è` `‚öíÔ∏è` `ü§ñ` `‚úÖ`

## Current Lore Hooks

- Ritual: Forge crafts allied automata that secure victory.
- Outcome emphasis: highlight triumphant resolution without revealing classified tactics.
- Chain cadence: four beats; recommend VO pacing `Forge` (beat) `crafts` (beat) `the Ally` (beat) `leads to Victory`.

## Pronunciation and Delivery

- `Forge`: hard "g"; evoke industrial resonance.
- `Ally`: stress first syllable; friendly tone.
- Arrow glyph (`‚Üí`): read as "leads to" rather than "arrow".
- Overall tone: authoritative but celebratory; default narrator persona is War Office herald unless overruled.

## Glyph-to-VO Guidance

- `üõ†Ô∏è` (forge sigil): cue metallic strike sound underlay.
- `‚öíÔ∏è`: reinforce forging action; brief dual-hit Foley.
- `ü§ñ`: articulate "Ally" with slight mechanized filter.
- `‚úÖ`: resolve with upward inflection signaling mission success.

## Open Questions for War Office

- Confirm narrator persona (War Office herald vs frontline correspondent).
- Define fallback language if narration must be localized (list priority locales).
- Approve background ambience palette (industrial forge, marching cadence, silent).
- Provide guidance on handling longer chains and repeated glyph sequences.
- Clarify whether VO should mirror `summary` text verbatim or allow adaptive storytelling.

## Workspace Status ‚Äî r_and_d_ai_0

- **2025-10-26:** Brief reviewed alongside payload checklist; awaiting War Office VO session scheduling. Local narration backlog updated to reference Pivot Five rollout tasks.

## Session Preparation Notes

- Share this brief alongside `quint_synced/payload_alignment.md` before the meeting.
- Capture decisions + pronunciation rulings in repo (update this doc or append `narration_alignment.md` changelog).
- Request War Office to supply draft VO script + pronunciation key by agreed deadline after session.
