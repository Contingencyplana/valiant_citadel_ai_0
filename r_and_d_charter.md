# R&D Charter — AI Labscape Architecture

**High Command AI 0 · Updated 2025-10-18**

## Genesis Workspace Context

`r_and_d_ai_0` serves as one of the five initial Genesis Workspaces, implementing the R&D Pivotal Front. It operates within the High Command exchange protocol, receiving orders and submitting experimental results through standardized interfaces.

### Exchange Integration

- Receives orders via `high_command_ai_0` exchange
- Submits experimental results using `field-report@1.0` schema
- Maintains schema compliance per Order-036 requirements
- Uses exchange protocol for cross-workspace coordination

### Operational Boundaries

- Primary workspace for innovation and experimentation
- Future parent of `tons_of_fun_ai_0` gameplay focus
- Direct interfaces with Safety and Manufacturing workspaces
- Consumer of Toyfoundry artifacts, producer of prototypes

## Core Vision: The 256 AI Labscapes

Our fundamental mission is the creation, development, and orchestration of 256 AI labscapes (ai_labscapes_0 through ai_labscapes_255), each containing 4,096 AI labs/Alfas, forming a total infrastructure of 1,048,576 autonomous AI units. This massive neural architecture will serve as the cognitive foundation for:

1. **Primary:** Toysoldiers AI core intelligence
2. **Secondary:** Nightlands multiplayer systems
3. **Tertiary:** Other pivotal fronts
