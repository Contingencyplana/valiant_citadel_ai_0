# R&D Charter — AI Labscape Architecture

**High Command AI 0 · Updated 2025-10-18**

## Genesis Workspace Context

`r_and_d_ai_0` serves as one of the five initial Genesis Workspaces, implementing the R&D Pivotal Front. It operates within the High Command exchange protocol, receiving orders and submitting experimental results through standardized interfaces.

### Exchange Integration

- Receives orders via `high_command_ai_0` exchange
- Submits experimental results using `field-report@1.0` schema
- Maintains schema compliance per Order-036 requirements
- Uses exchange protocol for cross-workspace coordination

### Operational Boundaries

- Primary workspace for innovation and experimentation
- Future parent of `tons_of_fun_ai_0` gameplay focus
- Direct interfaces with Safety and Manufacturing workspaces
- Consumer of Toyfoundry artifacts, producer of prototypes

## Core Vision: The 256 AI Labscapes

Our fundamental mission is the creation, development, and orchestration of 256 AI labscapes (ai_labscapes_0 through ai_labscapes_255), each containing 4,096 AI labs/Alfas, forming a total infrastructure of 1,048,576 autonomous AI units. This massive neural architecture will serve as the cognitive foundation for:

1. **Primary:** Toysoldiers AI core intelligence
2. **Secondary:** Nightlands multiplayer systems
3. **Tertiary:** Other pivotal fronts

## Mission Statement

To architect, implement, and perfect the 256 AI labscape infrastructure through systematic research, iterative development, and rigorous testing, while maintaining unwavering alignment with our core principles of Love, Light, Safety, and Sanity.
