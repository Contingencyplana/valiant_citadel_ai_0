# Safety Monitoring Systems

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for safety monitoring systems and procedures across all AI labscape operations. It defines how we track, analyze, and respond to safety-related events and metrics.

## Monitoring Architecture

### Real-time Monitoring

- Tone/entropy assessment
- Behavioral analysis
- Resource tracking
- Performance metrics
- Pivot Five telemetry hooks (schema drift, narrator usage)

### Alert Systems

- Detection mechanisms
- Classification rules
- Distribution protocols
- Response triggers
- Glyph/VO discrepancy escalations

### Data Collection

- Metrics gathering
- Log aggregation
- Status tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Emoji-first payload snapshots

## Monitoring Categories

### Safety Metrics

- Kill-switch readiness
- Containment integrity
- Policy compliance
- Response times
- Emoji schema integrity

### System Health

- Infrastructure status
- Service availability
- Resource utilization
- Performance indicators
- Narrator service coverage

### Behavioral Patterns

- AI lab/Alfa behavior
- Resource usage patterns
- Communication flows
- Interaction analysis
- Glyph-to-voice cadence adherence

## Implementation Guidelines

### Setup Requirements

1. Monitoring infrastructure
2. Data collection systems
3. Alert configuration
4. Response automation
5. Pivot Five hook deployment (`schema_guard`, `narrator_log`, `glyph_vo_audit`)

### Maintenance Procedures

- Regular calibration
- System updates
- Performance tuning
- Documentation updates
- Pivot Five hook validation (weekly)

## Response Procedures

### Alert Handling

1. Detection and classification
2. Initial assessment
3. Response initiation
4. Incident tracking

### Escalation Path

- Level 1: Automated response
- Level 2: Team intervention
- Level 3: Emergency protocol
- Level 4: Full shutdown

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets

- Detection speed: < 10ms
- Alert processing: < 50ms
- Response initiation: < 100ms
- Resolution tracking: Real-time

### Quality Standards

- Zero missed alerts
- 99.999% uptime
- Full data retention
- Complete audit trail

## Documentation Requirements

### System Documentation

- Architecture details
- Configuration guides
- Operation procedures
- Maintenance plans
- Pivot Five hook runbooks

### Incident Records

- Alert history
- Response logs
- Resolution details
- Analysis reports
