## Critical Pathways

### Policy Flow (golf_00)
- Receives validation results from all systems
- Issues compliance decisions
- Controls operational parameters
- Manages safety thresholds

### Emergency Flow (golf_01)
- Monitors critical thresholds
- Reports to policy system
- Triggers emergency stops
- Validates containment status

### Assessment Flow (golf_02)
- Continuous tone monitoring
- Real-time entropy checks
- Reports anomalies upward
- Feeds containment system

### Containment Flow (golf_03)
- Validates system boundaries
- Reports containment status
- Receives assessment data
- Implements policy controls

## Integration Points

1. Policy → Kill-Switch
   - Safety thresholds
   - Emergency criteria
   - Shutdown protocols

2. Policy → Assessment
   - Acceptable parameters
   - Warning thresholds
   - Report requirements

3. Kill-Switch → Containment
   - Emergency states
   - Boundary verification
   - System isolation

4. Assessment → Containment
   - Behavioral metrics
   - Entropy levels
   - Boundary conditions

## Validation Chain

1. Assessment tools monitor system state
2. Containment verifies boundaries
3. Kill-switch stands ready
4. Policy system oversees all

## Success Criteria

- All systems reporting to policy
- Kill-switch receiving thresholds
- Assessment feeding containment
- Containment status verified
