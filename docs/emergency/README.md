# Emergency Response Procedures

## Overview

This directory contains emergency response procedures and protocols for handling safety incidents across all AI labscape operations. These procedures ensure rapid, coordinated responses to potential safety threats.

## Emergency Response Types

### Critical Safety Incidents

- Kill-switch activation scenarios
- Containment breach responses
- Tone/entropy anomalies
- Resource overconsumption

### Workspace-Specific Emergencies

- R&D containment failures
- Manufacturing pipeline issues
- Field operation incidents
- Cross-workspace coordination

### System-Wide Events

- Multi-labscape incidents
- Infrastructure failures
- Communication breakdowns
- Policy violation cascades

## Response Protocols

### Immediate Actions

1. Incident Detection & Classification
2. Kill-switch Evaluation
3. Containment Measures
4. Alert Distribution
5. Resource Isolation

### Communication Procedures

- Alert chain activation
- Cross-workspace notification
- Status reporting
- Update frequency

### Recovery Steps

1. Incident stabilization
2. System verification
3. Safety revalidation
4. Operational restoration

## Response Teams
