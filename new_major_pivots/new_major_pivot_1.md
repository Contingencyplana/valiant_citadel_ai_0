# Major Pivot One: 70% Play / 30% Dev-Ops Ratio

**Status:** Approved  
**Date Proposed:** 2025-10-17  
**Authorizing Body:** War Office + High Command  
**Impact:** Critical — redefines operational methodology

---

## Problem Statement

Current workflow requires extensive interaction with:
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- PowerShell terminal commands
- GitHub version control
- Azure Cloud infrastructure

**Time allocation:**
- ~70-80% dev-ops (coding, debugging, documentation, terminal commands)
- ~20-30% strategic/creative work

**Impact on operator:** Soul-destroying incredible boredom and tedium; mindless, soulless and heartless drudgery; consequent cognitive and creative drain, unsustainable long-term

---

## Pivot Description

**Invert the ratio to:**
- **70% play time** — interacting with game-like interfaces, making tactical decisions on battlegrids
- **30% dev-ops time** — residual monitoring, strategic planning, high-level architecture

**Mechanism:**
- AI agents (High Command, Toyfoundry, Toysoldiers) handle VSCode/PowerShell/GitHub/Azure operations autonomously
- Human operator interacts via playable workflow overlay (see Major Pivot Two)
- Automation translates play actions into underlying technical operations

---

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ **Human operator spends ≥70% of session time** in game interface (battlegrids, tactical decisions)
2. ✅ **Dev-ops tasks automated** — commits, deployments, telemetry monitoring handled by AI agents
3. ✅ **Manual coding interventions ≤30%** of total time
4. ✅ **Workflow efficiency maintained or improved** (throughput, quality metrics remain green)

---

## Dependencies

- **Major Pivot Two** — requires playable workflow overlay to exist
- **Telemetry Quilt** — must provide real-time game state updates
- **Exchange Protocol** — must translate game actions into factory-orders

---

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| AI agents make errors without human oversight | Telemetry warnings surfaced in game UI (danger zones on battlegrids) |
| Game interface insufficient for complex decisions | Retain VSCode access for 30% edge cases; improve game UI iteratively |
| Operator disengagement if game becomes tedious | Design victory/progression mechanics to maintain engagement (see Alfa Zero spec) |

---

## Implementation Notes

- **Phase 1:** Build one playable Alfa (prototype validates feasibility)
- **Phase 2:** Expand to 16 Alfas (one per golf_00 slot)
- **Phase 3:** Scale to 4,096 Alfas (full fractal structure)

**Measurement:** Track time spent in game UI vs. VSCode/PowerShell via session telemetry

---

## Approval Status

**Approved by:** War Office (civilian oversight) + High Command (military execution)  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Review Cycle:** Every 256 Alfas deployed (fractal checkpoints)
