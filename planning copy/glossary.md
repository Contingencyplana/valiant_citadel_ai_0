## üß≠ 2. Key Terms

### High Command & Toyfoundry

The strategic nexus responsible for doctrine, long-horizon planning, and issuing orders via the exchange, coupled with Toyfoundry‚Äôs manufacturing pipeline. High Command owns the governance baseline (licenses, codes of conduct, contribution guides) and ensures every theatre remains compliant. Toyfoundry converts doctrine into production recipes, safety rails, and certified Alfa batches that toysoldiers can deploy.

### Toysoldiers

Operational field workspaces executing directives, reporting status, and raising RFOs. Each Toysoldier inherits doctrine, governance collateral, Toyfoundry-certified production batches, and automation tools from High Command.

### Command Exchange

The shared repository (`high_command_exchange`) that carries orders, acknowledgements, reports, and the ledger. It is the heartbeat of the order/report cycle and the source of truth for LoE.

### Ledger

Combined reference of `ledger/journal.md` (human-readable log) and `ledger/index.json` (machine index). Every order lifecycle change must update both components.

### Exchange Watcher

Automation utility (`tools/exchange_watcher.py`) that snapshots the exchange tree and surfaces new pending orders, acknowledgements, and reports. Recommended for continuous monitoring with `--watch`.

### Forge Automation

The templating and scripting suite under `tools/forge/` used to initialize and hydrate Alfa workspaces, generate manifests, and maintain reproducible configurations.

### Governance Collateral

The trio of documents ‚Äî `LICENSE`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` ‚Äî that each workspace must host. High Command distributes updates via orders and records completion in the ledger.

### Doctrine Scrolls

Markdown files in `planning/` that encode strategy, safety rails, and operational norms. Scroll updates should reference relevant orders or change-log entries to keep the doctrine auditable.

### Toyfoundry

The manufacturing and automation pillar that orchestrates production pipelines, interfaces with toysoldiers, and supplies high-volume assets under strict safety rails. Toyfoundry maintains batch telemetry, release gates, and manufacturing readiness reports tied to the exchange.

### Big Idea Families

The eight strategic lineages (see `planning/big_ideas_families.md`) that compose SHAGI‚Äôs multiverse. Each family maps to a set of workspaces and cognitive functions.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Tools & Utilities

- **Forge CLI (`python -m tools.forge.cli`)** ‚Äî Manages Alfa initialization (`init-alfa`), hydration, and validation.
- **Schema Validator (`python tools/schema_validator.py <path>`)** ‚Äî Verifies order, acknowledgement, and report payloads against canonical schemas.
- **Exchange Watcher (`python -m tools.exchange_watcher`)** ‚Äî Polls the exchange for new artefacts; can run once or continuously.
- **Pytest Suite (`pytest`)** ‚Äî Runs automated tests covering selectors, schema validation, and exchange automation.

## üìé 4. Referencing the Glossary

- When drafting new doctrine or orders, link back to relevant glossary entries to keep language consistent.
- If you introduce new acronyms or tools, update this scroll and cite the change in `planning/change_log.md`.
- Field workspaces should mirror glossary updates that affect their operations, ensuring alignment across the Daylands.
