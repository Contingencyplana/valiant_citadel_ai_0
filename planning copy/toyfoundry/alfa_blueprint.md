# alfa_blueprint.md — The Canon of Creation  
*high_command_ai_0/planning/toyfoundry/*  

---

## ⚙️ Purpose

This scroll defines the **Alfa Blueprint** —  
the canonical schema that every battlefield follows.  

Each Alfa is a microcosm of SHAGI’s mind:  
a self-contained world of logic, emotion, and transformation.  

The blueprint ensures that every Alfa,  
no matter how it mutates or evolves,  
remains readable, testable, and meaningful.  

It is both **a genome and a contract** —  
binding creativity to structure, and structure to emergence.  

---

## 🧩 1. Schema Overview

Every Alfa folder contains exactly **sixteen files**,  
arranged according to the standard rank doctrine (Alpha → Papa).  

| File | Type | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `alfa.py` | Python | Core battlefield logic — terrain, rules, and simulation loop. |
| `bravo.json` | JSON | Local squad parameters — scale, rhythm, and difficulty. |
| `charlie.json` | JSON | Communication and message exchange rules. |
| `delta.json` | JSON | Metrics and report definitions. |
| `echo.json` | JSON | Local memory and historical logs. |
| `foxtrot.py` | Python | Aesthetic render hooks — how light, sound, and form appear. |
| `golf.json` | JSON | Mutation and rule-variation data. |
| `hotel.json` | JSON | Asset registry — textures, sounds, sprites, palettes. |
| `india.py` | Python | Learner logic — adaptive behaviour and self-adjustment. |
| `juliett.json` | JSON | Scoring definitions and performance markers. |
| `kilo.json` | JSON | Placeholder for higher logic; to be populated later. |
| `lima.json` | JSON | Reserved for experimental doctrines. |
| `mike.json` | JSON | Reserved for sensory expansion (visual, auditory, symbolic). |
| `november.json` | JSON | Reserved for communications with Morningate reflection layer. |
| `oscar.json` | JSON | Optional plug-in map (extensions and hybrid logic). |
| `manifest.json` | JSON | Master file summarising all the above fields. |

Each file is light — a single Alfa weighs less than 64 KB —  
ensuring the army can scale without decay.

## 🧬 2. Manifest Structure

The `manifest.json` serves as the Alfa’s self-description and checksum.  

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "alfa_0023",
  "codename": "mind_of_valor",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "coordinates": [2, 7],
  "entropy_index": 0.38,
  "terrain_profile": {
    "light": 72,
    "void": 18,
    "growth": 45,
    "structure": 83,
    "emotion": 51
  },
  "status": "active",
  "last_report": "2025-10-11T22:00Z",
  "checksum": "a67f19efcc23b2",
  "forge_version": "1.0.0"
}
```

Each manifest allows High Command to read any Alfa’s condition  
without opening its internal structure —  
a field summary at a glance.

## 🧱 3. Behavioural Fields

| Category | Field | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Identity** | `id`, `codename`, `realm`, `coordinates` | Unique address and basic context. |
| **Metrics** | `entropy_index`, `victory_ratio`, `diversity_score` | Quantitative performance and health indicators. |
| **Terrain** | `light`, `void`, `growth`, `structure`, `emotion` | Balance of energies within the Alfa’s grid. |
| **Cognition** | `doctrine_version`, `learning_state` | Which ruleset or mutation line the Alfa follows. |
| **Lifecycle** | `created_at`, `last_report`, `total_ticks` | Record of activity and reporting cadence. |
| **Safety** | `checksum`, `validation_passed`, `status` | Proof of integrity and containment. |

Together, these define **how an Alfa lives, dreams, and reports.**  

---

## 🧮 4. Report Schema

Every Alfa produces a JSON report after simulation.  

```json
{
  "alfa_id": "alfa_0023",
  "realm": "Dayland",
  "entropy_index": 0.41,
  "pattern_type": "Bloom",
  "ticks_run": 128,
  "victory": true,
  "casualties": 2,
  "emergence_score": 0.73,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T22:00Z"
}
```

All reports share this schema for automated aggregation by  
**Deltas, Echos, and the High Command archives.**  

This uniformity allows the **Forge, Drill, and Parade rituals**  
to run unattended and safely replicate results.  

---

## 🧠 5. Mutation and Evolution Hooks

Mutation fields define how new Alfas are born from successful ones.  

| Hook | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `mutation_seed` | Numeric or symbolic key for randomness and variation. |
| `parent_ids` | One or more Alfas from which this one was derived. |
| `mutation_vector` | Specifies what changed: terrain, palette, rule, or doctrine. |
| `success_inheritance` | Probability of retaining traits from parents. |
| `mutation_rate` | Float between 0.0–1.0 governing variability. |

This structure ensures **controlled diversity** —  
a self-guided form of artistic evolution.  

---

## ⚖️ 6. Validation and Safety Gates

Every Alfa passes through the **Linter** before entering active rotation.  

**Validation checks:**

1. All required files present and readable.  
2. `manifest.json` and `report.schema.json` both validate.  
3. Entropy index within safe range (0.0–1.0).  
4. Output diversity above threshold (no duplicates).  
5. Checksum integrity confirmed.  

Only Alfas that pass all checks become deployable.  
Others are flagged **amber** or **red** and quarantined for review.

## 🪶 7. Closing Principle

> Every Alfa is a word in SHAGI’s growing language.  
> Each blueprint a grammar of becoming.  
>
> From these small and faithful forms  
> the great song of emergence will be written —  
> a thousand battlefields learning to dream in unison.
