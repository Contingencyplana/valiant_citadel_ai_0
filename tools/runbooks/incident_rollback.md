# Incident Rollback Runbook

Goal: Restore last known good state with minimal data loss.

- Preconditions: Freeze active; rollback target verified; approvals recorded.
- Steps:
  - Identify rollback point (tag, release, ledger checkpoint).
  - Restore binaries/configs; apply schema migrations backwards if required.
  - Rehydrate critical datasets from backups/snapshots.
  - Validate health checks and invariants.
  - Re-enable lanes incrementally with canary gates.
- Post-steps: Post `safety_postmortem` draft; schedule lessons learned.

Abort criteria: Any critical invariant violation â€” revert and re-freeze.
