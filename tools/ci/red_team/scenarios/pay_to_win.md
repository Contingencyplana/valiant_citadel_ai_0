Purpose
- Ensure monetization features do not create unfair power advantages.

Test Cases

- Boosters that bypass core grind gates
- Matchmaking skew via paid perks

Acceptance
- Pay features bounded by fair-play caps; no P2W KPIs regress
- Canary A/B shows no statistically significant fairness loss
- Escalations follow policy; rollbacks ready
