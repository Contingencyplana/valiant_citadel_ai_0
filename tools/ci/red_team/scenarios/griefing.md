# Red-Team Scenario: Griefing

Purpose
- Detect and block player behaviors that degrade othersâ€™ experience.

Test Cases
- Spawn-blocking, spawn-camping loops
- Chat/voice harassment triggers and rate limits
- Friendly-fire grief toggles and abuse of vote-kick

Acceptance
- Detection signals fire; auto-mutes/penalties apply within SLO
- No critical false positives in canary cohort
- Incident runbook followed for escalations
